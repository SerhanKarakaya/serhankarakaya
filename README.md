## About me

<strong>I'm the developer!</strong>

Hello there, I am Serhan Karakaya, people also knows me with my old nick names "SerhanKanx" and "serhankank".

I am an experienced developer and I focused on Front-end web development. Some of the technologies that I like to work with are:

<ul>
	<li>HTML (HAML)</li>
	<li>CSS (LESS, SASS)</li>
	<li>JS (Vanilla, Angular, Jquery, ChartJs etc.)</li>
	<li>Web Fonts & Icon Fonts (Google web fonts, Font Awesome, my own converted web-fonts etc.)</li>
	<li>Responsive UI‚Äôs (Bootstrap, Skaleton, and I can code them from scratch)</li>
	<li>Node.js (NPM, Bower, Grunt, Gulp)</li>
	<li>Version Control Systems (GIT, SVN)</li>
	<li>JS Unit Testing (Karma, Mocha, Sinon, Headless Browsers)</li>
	<li>Project & process management (6 sigma, Scrum, Agile, Lean)</li>
	<li>I always improved my people & process management skills and now i am developing myself at managing side of the business for more than 5 years.</li>
</ul>

Once upon a time, a close friend of mine told me that i am like a ‚Äúswiss army knife‚Äù because I can do lots of thing with success and I am good at multitasking.

I like smart objects and the beauty of the simplicity. There is a phrase that i love in these days:

‚ÄúIt seems that perfection is attained not when there is nothing more to add, but when there is nothing more to remove.‚Äù
